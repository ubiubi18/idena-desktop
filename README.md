# Idena Desktop

Idena Desktop client for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org),
[React](https://react.dev), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

[![Lint and tests](https://github.com/ubiubi18/idena-desktop/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ubiubi18/idena-desktop/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

> This community-maintained fork has no published or code-signed desktop
> releases. The upstream Idena release feed does not contain these changes.
> Build from a reviewed commit before using the app with a valuable identity.

## Fork status

The renderer remains compatible with the existing Idena RPC and application
data layout. The bundled node is built from the exact `idena-go` and
`idena-wasm-binding` commits in `scripts/source-manifest.json`; source setup
verifies those commits and required files before building.

Those source pins are additionally constrained by
[`compatibility/stack-lock.json`](compatibility/stack-lock.json). Release
preflight fails if the desktop manifest drifts from the reviewed
legacy-compatibility candidate.

### What was updated

- Node `24.18.0`, npm `11.16.0`, Electron `43.1.0`, Next.js `16.2`, and
  compatible renderer dependencies replace the legacy Node 10-era toolchain.
- Desktop API keys are generated with a cryptographically secure random source
  and private files are created with user-only permissions.
- DuckDuckGo image search was restored behind validated, normalized result
  handling and regression tests.
- The obsolete Fabric-based editor and SDK dependency were removed; the flip
  editor now uses a smaller local implementation.
- Source-built node preparation, artifact checks, privacy checks, Electron
  safety checks, dependency/signature audits, and release preflight checks are
  automated in CI.
- Native node build paths are defined for Windows x64, macOS x64/ARM64, and the
  Linux packaging flow.

### Benefits

- A current desktop runtime with fewer vulnerable and abandoned packages.
- Reproducible node and Wasm inputs instead of an unverified downloaded node.
- Reduced credential exposure and better checks for renderer, IPC, external
  URLs, image search, and packaged artifacts.

### Risks and tradeoffs

- This fork is not an official, signed Idena wallet release. Local packages are
  development artifacts and may trigger operating-system trust warnings.
- Electron and Next.js upgrades can expose UI, database, native-module, or
  packaging regressions that unit tests do not reproduce.
- `npm start` is a development mode. Do not rely on it for an unattended or
  valuable validation session.
- Back up the complete `userData` directory before switching between upstream
  and fork builds. Never run two clients against the same node database.
- Native node builds use CGO and must be built on the target operating system;
  the build script intentionally rejects cross-platform packaging.

## Getting started

There is no fork release download yet. For the official upstream application,
use the [upstream releases](https://github.com/idena-network/idena-desktop/releases/latest).
Those binaries do not include this fork's modernization work.

### Get to know Idena

Visit [Idena](https://idena.io) for the [most common questions](https://idena.io/?view=faq) and [guidelines](https://idena.io/?view=guide).

### Configuration

Most of the configuration is available in `userData` directory:

- `%APPDATA%\Idena` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/Idena` on macOS
- `~/.config/Idena` on Linux

**Note:** Manual configuration can corrupt the installation or expose the RPC
interface. Edit configuration only after making a backup and understanding the
effect of each setting.

### Logs

Logs are available in `logs` directory:

- `%APPDATA%\Idena\logs` on Windows
- `~/Library/Logs/Idena` on macOS
- `~/.config/Idena/idena.log` on Linux

### Built-in node

Node configuration and data files located in `node` directory inside `userData`:

- `%APPDATA%\Idena\node` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/Idena/node` on macOS
- `~/.config/Idena/node` on Linux

The built-in node directory structure is the same as for standalone node.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `24.18.0` on the Node 24 LTS line
- npm `11.16.0`
- Go `1.26.5`
- A C compiler suitable for the host operating system
- Git

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
npm run setup:sources
```

Before running or packaging, execute the maintained checks:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand
npm run lint
npm run release:check
```

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

### Build

Builds are packaged with [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/).
Run packaging on the target operating system.

You may build for the current platform:

```bash
npm run dist
```

or for a specific platform

```bash
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:mac:arm64
npm run dist:mac:universal
npm run dist:linux
```

Use `npm run pack` for an unpacked local test build. Release scripts may contain
publishing flags, but no release is published unless a matching release process
and credentials are deliberately configured.

Pull requests are welcome.
